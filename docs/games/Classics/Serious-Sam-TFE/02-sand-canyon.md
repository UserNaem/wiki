As the player who triggers the exit:

- After opening the door, get boosted along the left hill so that you slide along it for extra speed.
- When at the corner, get boosted uphill until you reach the flat part of the hill. There is a large, invisible teleport field that you will have to avoid, so your teammates cannot boost you too much.
- Navigate to the "bright spot" in the flat part, as that is where the left boundary of the teleport field ends.
- Fall down the slope and [jump-buffer](../../overview#buffer-jumps) as you go [out of bounds](../../overview#out-of-bounds) to maximize your chances of being able to fly downwards.
    - If your feet were touching the ground as you entered the out of bounds, then you should go back in-bounds and try again, similar to the video below. Without flying downwards, exiting the level would take longer because you have to travel a longer distance instead of straight to the exit trigger.
- Fly towards the element in the middle of the room, as opposed to the cutscene trigger from single-player.
