# Hatshepsut

Aight so this level doesn't really need any wiki faq walkthrough but ima let you know how to complete it successfully. Skip the cutscenes ASAP and whatever you do DO NOT turn around and head into the desert it's a trap, instead go straight forward and jump up the ramp then kill the gnaar guarding (or more like spawning in your face) the door to the jacuzzi room, enter it take a bath and move into the next room, grab the shotgun to the left not because you need it to take care of business (duh) but because it spawns a bunch of monsters that are so eager to kill you that they open up the locked door that leads to the level exit so just sneak in when the door is open and you're all set ready to leave hatshepsut (MOD EDIT: i actually looked this up and hatshepsut is apparently not a place but in reality a guy... yeahhhhh doesn't make sense but that's what i found anyway) and egypt... or are you?
