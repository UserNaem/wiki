We aim to document the tricks and optimizations used in speedruns of Serious Sam, and to provide guides and tutorials for the speedruns. This project is still in its infancy, so not much content is currently available. However, if you wish to contribute, feel free to open a pull request at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ssdq/wiki) or propose changes on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/0vKwJa1xQoCpw7vY).
